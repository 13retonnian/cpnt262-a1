      Where does Halloween come from?
    </h3>
    <p class="autumn-class">
      Halloween used to be an old pagan festival that celebrated the Autumnal Equinox.  
      During this time pagans believed that the spirits of the dead would return to the earth. 
      It was then changed into <em>All</em> Saints Day when society became Christian. 
      It then morphed into Hallowed Evening. 
      Then eventually became Halloween.
      <strong>COOL!!</strong>
