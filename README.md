### Toggle Button Information
This toggle button is very spooky. It changes most everything on the about page into a spooky form. It then changes into the Halloween button where it will return the page back to normal if you toggle it. 

### Reflection:
#### Note 1 technical issue you had while creating this:
I can't get the button to look like a button. The text goes off center when I click it and I'm not sure why.. The text on the paragraphs isn't clamping.
#### How did you approach solving it:
changes the border width. changed the button's class. changed from px to em.
